### Start Game
- The homepage to the game displays the start button. Once clicked you will be navagated to the game instructions page. By keeping the game plateform simple and user friendly, I decided to show a large button and with a round shape. This is to keep within the traditional button design for a user to be more familiar with the platform.

# User Stories
- As a user I would like to have an easy understanding of how to play this game.

- When reading the instructions I want it to be informative but kept short with instructions 

- I want to be able to navigate easly from the very start of the game with just the click of a button. 

-  When playing the game, I expect the game to function correctly with my choices and if playing the computer, it functions as to how the game is explained in the instructions.

- I would like to see a scoring counter for my score and the computers score.

- As games are fun, I want to see bright colors or fun images to keep it exciting. I want to also see interactive feartures that give detail to the game.  

### Game Title
- The game title Rock Paper Scissors gives the user a good idea as to what the game maybe about. This will keep the user guessing and to try and encourage the user to play the game.

### Game area
- The main game area is where the fun begins. Here the user will be able to use the game fucntions dislayed and interact with the game. The game area is set out to be to easy to read and use. The use of colours and icons will help keep the game interesing and to explain each function with matching icons as to its function.

### Game Instructions
- The game instructions are displayed after the user clicks in the start button. This is intendedto give an easier way for the user to find the instructions before entering the game. 

- The instructions are layed out in a simple family font to match that of the games tittle. This gives a symmetric feel throughout the game.

### Buttons area
- All buttons are displayed with an icon to give the user a better understanding of what button functions do once clicked.  

- Each button has a curser point set to change once the user hoovers over each button, this to let the user know they are ready to click a button. 

- All buttons have a interactive change of color #C6D93B. This also to give a interaction between the user and ther game.

### media quiries

- For mobile screen sizes of a max-width 300px, all button sizes are reduced in size to accommodate a small screen. The main area will change to have the users choice buttons set to a display block formation, this is intended to give a better user feel when playing on a mobile screen size. 

![](readme.images/mobile%20screen.png)

- For tablet screen sizes from 500px to 1000px, the game structure dose not change from a desktop screen size. The game layout is intended to be user friendly on almost all devices and will only need to be changed when a small screen size is used such as a mobile devise.

# Colors 
- All colors are picked using a Adobe colour wheel. I used a color chart which features colur trends for game design .

- The backgorund colour is set to a dark purple to give more contrast to the lighter game colours. ( #021226 )

-  For the main game area, I used a medium shape of pink to bring more excitement to the game and in which complaints the background color. ( #4E458C )

- The start button uses a lighter shaped of pink to complement both the game area and main background color. This keeps a nice flow of shades and to reduce complexity when useing colors. ( #A9A7D9 )

- Game title uses a meduim green to stand out from the shades of pink. Pink and green should never be seen, but as it's a fun game, I decided it's aloud. ( #02733E )

- I used yellow as a highlight icons and for when the mouse cursor hoovers over the start button. This helps to break up colors but also to give interactions with certain events. ( #C6D93B )
